There is an  **enormous**  difference in the  **ways**  in which various public officials respond to public  **pressures** , and in the means and  **methods**  they employ to deal with them. The  **best**  possess understanding of the  **forces**  that must be  **taken**  into account,  **determination**  not to be  **swerved**  from the path of public interest, a  **willingness**  to make  **enemies**  along with a gift for avoiding them and faith that public support will be forthcoming for the correct course. The poorest are overhesitant, evasive, preoccupied with their relationships with their colleagues, superiors, the press or the political support on which they lean.
