Cats know many things: how to catch mice, what the sound of the can opener means, and even how to take over the internet.

But the one question cat expert Atsuko Saito always gets is whether cats recognize their own names, an ability that's well known in dogs.

In a new study in the journal Scientific Reports, the psychologist at Tokyo¡¯s Sophia University showed that they do know their names¡ªeven when called by a stranger.

Cats are Saito favorite animal, and after studying primate cognition in graduate school, she set her research sights on the oft-misunderstood pets. (Is everything you think about cats wrong?)

¡°I love cats. They¡¯re so cute and so selfish. When they want to be touched, they¡¯ll come by me, but when they want to be left alone, they¡¯ll just leave,¡± she says, laughing.

Her past experiments have revealed cats can interpret human gestures to find hidden food, recognize their owner¡¯s voice, and beg for food from a person who looks at them and calls their name¡ªall of which suggested that felines know their names
